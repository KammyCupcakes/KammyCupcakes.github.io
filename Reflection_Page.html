                All my four years at Madison have been an experience, to say the least. I am extremely grateful for the opportunities this school has given me and I am glad that I decided to stay at this school. Madison has left me better off than any of the other schools that I was considering going to back in my freshman year when I was thinking of transferring. My freshman year found myself coming into my own skin and becoming the better person I wanted to see in high school. I made friends quickly and relatively excelled in my academics.
                Then when it came to a vocation that year I started in Automotive Technology as I always had enjoyed working and messing with cars. I enjoyed it for the time being and learned a lot in my class and was one of the top students when I was there. I saw myself losing the enjoyability factor as the year progressed and I began dreading every second in the shop but I gave it another year just to see if things would change for me. I also found myself in the running club Sole Train which I find myself working for currently.
                My sophomore year found me still excelling in my academic classes and I began my dual enrollment journey. It also saw me transfer out of Automotive Technology and moved into Computer Programming and Web Development. Right out the jump I caught on quickly to the material and saw myself catch up to my peers relatively fast. Unlike Automotive Technology I found myself actually having fun and saw a future in CPWD. Sadly the pandemic did role around close to the end of the year but that didn’t stop me from doing the work assigned during that period of time; I even completed my OSHA during that time as well.
                My Junior saw me at home learning and at this point I started dual enrollment full time and was excelling in those 4 classes I was taking at the time and I was doing well in CPWD as well. I still very much enjoyed it even though I would’ve certainly enjoyed learning in person and being around my peers as they do help motivate and give me inspiration. Being online throughout the entirety of Junior was hard especially for my peers but I tried to do my best to keep their spirits up and motivate them to be their best selfs. Senior comes around and we are back in person and I am so glad we are back in person and learning has been much easier.
                I am still taking college classes now and my advisors at Madision have helped me get into 6 out of the 7 colleges that I applied to and even helped me get scholarships. If it wasn’t from the help of them I wouldn’t be the first child in my family to go to college so I am extremely grateful for all they have done. Especially my vocational teachers that I have had over the years who believed in me all throughout my journey here. If it wasn’t for the faith my teachers had for me I don’t think I would be where I currently am I now.
